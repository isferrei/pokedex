## Pokedex
Pokedex is a web application that allows you to search for Pokemon and view their details, such as their type, height, and weight. This project was created using Next.js and the PokeAPI and styled using CSS Modules.

Getting Started
To run the project locally, you will need to have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download and install it from the official Node.js website.

Once you have Node.js installed, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/isferrei/pokedex.git
- Navigate to the project directory using cd pokedex
- Install the project dependencies using npm install
- Start the development server using npm run dev
- Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000

Usage
To use the Pokedex, simply type the name or number of the Pokemon you want to search for into the search bar on the home page. The app will then display a list of matching Pokemon, and you can click on one to view its details.

You can also navigate directly to a specific Pokemon's page by entering its number or name in the URL. For example, to view details about Pikachu, you can navigate to http://localhost:3000/pokemon/pikachu.
